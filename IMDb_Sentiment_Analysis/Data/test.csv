"A paean to the proletariat.  A pro-union battle cry.  An ideological evisceration of late capitalism.  A deconstruction of corporate greed and the concomitant commercialisation of self-worth necessary to succeed.  A critique of identity politics.  An allegory of institutional racism in big business.  A lampooning of Silicon Valley bro culture.  Sorry to Bother You,  the debut feature of writer/director Boots Riley,  is all this,  and more.  Very much in the key of absurdist fiction such as Dino Buzzati's Il deserto dei Tartari (1940)  and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (1952) , as well as race-conscious satirical cinema such as Robert Downey Sr. 's Putney Swope (1969)  and Melvin Van Peebles's Watermelon Man (1970) , whilst drawing more direct inspiration from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust (c. 1806-1831) , Alex Cox's Repo Man (1984) , and the work of Spike Jonze,  Michel Gondry,  and,  bizarrely,  Ken Loach,  Sorry to Bother You is a black comedy/Juvenalian satire/science fiction/horror/magic realist/allegorical character study.  In short,  it's impossible to classify.  Dealing with the obstacles facing African Americans in a white-dominated corporate milieu,  and positing that the experience of workers is determined by both labour conditions and race,  the film examines labour relations,  wage issues,  worker solidarity,  unionism,  mass media,  and the dangers of betraying oneself and choosing corporate advancement over friendships,  relationships,  and personal integrity.  Although it's a beat or two too long,  and although the spectacularly bizarre left-turn at the end of the second act will surely alienate a lot of viewers,  the deconstruction and comic appropriation of code-switching results in a film that is constantly inventive,  highly confrontational,  and extremely funny. Set in Oakland,  California in an ""alternate present"", Cash Green (Lakeith Stanfield)  is a telemarketer working for RegalView,  who,  upon the advice of a veteran co-worker (Danny Glover) , discovers his ""white voice"" and rises to the top of the company's food chain.  however,  he learns that RegalView is selling slave labour to WorryFree,  a cult-like company that offers lodging and food in return for a lifetime contract with no wages.  Torn between exposing WorryFree and his substantial earnings,  Cash's dilemma is exacerbated when WorryFree CEO,  Steve Lift (a spectacular Armie Hammer)  However,  Cash then makes a discovery that changes everything,  but potentially for all of humanity. At its heart,  Sorry to Bother is an anti-corporate,  proletarian rally cry,  something with which Riley has been engaged for decades; just listen to ""Fat Cats,  Bigga Fish"" from Genocide & Juice (1994) , ""5 million ways to kill a C. E. O. "" from Party Music (2001) . However,  unlike Sam Levinson's recent satire Assassination Nation (2018) , Sorry to Bother You is not especially interested in politics per se,  certainly not in the explicit sense of films such as Sergei M.  Eisenstein's Stachka (1925) , Haskell Wexler's Medium Cool (1969) , or Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998) . This is not to say that the film ignores politics completely,  rather it approaches the subject obliquely.  For example,  the country's most popular TV show,  'I Got the S--t Kicked Out of Me', involves people being violently assaulted by family and friends and then dunked in a vat of faeces,  with Riley providing little to no contextualisation (think It's Not My Problem!  from RoboCop (1987) , where Bixby Snyder's (S. D.  Nemeth)  catchphrase,  ""I'd buy that for a dollar"", is used as a one-size-fits-all response to every situation) . This mindless consumption of meaningless and morally questionable content indicates the passivity of the masses,  their critical faculties either dormant or absent entirely (an inverse verfremdungseffekt,  if you will) . Clips of the show feature prominently throughout the film,  allowing Riley to depict a milieu where popular entertainment has reached an unimaginable low.  Another example of a pseudo-political aspect of the film are the ubiquitous billboards and TV commercials advertising WorryFree,  suggesting the corruption or co-opting of mass media.  Additionally,  Left Eye clearly recalls Antifa. Instead of politics,  Riley's focus is very much on economic issues,  with a lot of the humour derived from pecuniary-based situations.  One of the easiest ways to parse the film is to approach it as a parable about selling out,  equal parts polemic and acknowledgement that it's next to impossible not to sell out in some way.  Indeed,  the last act of the film explicitly deals with the literal dehumanisation of the workforce (and I do mean ""literal"" - to say any more would be a spoiler) . RegalView and WorryFree exist in an economic system built upon impoverishing the many for the benefit of the few,  with Riley attempting to expose the importance of a poverty line for the continued functioning of late capitalism.  Within such a system,  he suggests,  it is exceptionally difficult for African Americans to succeed unless they are willing to code-switch.  In this sense,  although the concept of ""white voice"" does have a practical function within the narrative,  its most salient characteristic is as an object of allegorical satire,  a hyperbolic caricature of what African Americans need to do to survive in the Caucasian bro-culture corporate ranks of Silicon Valley; they must literally relinquish part of the self and pretend to be something Other. Aesthetically,  the film adopts a visual style obviously influenced by Michel Gondry,  and,  to a lesser extent,  Terry Gilliam.  An especially interesting aesthetic device,  as anyone who has seen the trailer can attest,  is how white voice is handled - rather than having the actors simply speak in a different voice,  Riley instead has the white actors' voices overdubbed; when Salvador (Jermaine Fowler)  he literally tells him ""you sound overdubbed"". However,  the lip syncing is,  presumably intentionally,  far from perfect,  with the voice not quite aligning with the actors' mouth movements.  This throws the scenes ""off"" ever so slightly,  creating an extra layer of surreality,  and highlighting just how absurd the whole thing is,  drawing attention to the lengths these people have to go to achieve real success.  The fact that our culture places such value on ""correct"" intonation is,  in and of itself,  absurd,  like an extreme version of the phone voice that pretty much everyone has,  and by failing to perfectly sync white voice to black actor,  Riley is able to deconstruct and draw attention to this absurdity. The film's other big aesthetic innovation is having Cash plunge (not especially gracefully)  into the living room of the people he calls,  desk and all.  Obviously,  but,  at least in the early stages,  it also highlights Cash's own discomfit at being the intruder,  seen most clearly when he drops in on a couple having sex.  This is an excellently-handled piece of visual shorthand,  conveying Cash's internal process,  without having him verbalise it at any point. Also impressive is the acting.  Stanfield certainly holds his own,  with his body-language providing a clinic of wordless performing.  Early on in the film,  he's hunched over and put-upon,  his every movement seemingly uncomfortable,  as if ill at ease in his own skin.  however,  after his promotion at RegalView,  his physicality acquires a more easy nature,  he carries himself more confidently,  as if high-powered telemarketing has helped him to find himself,  something which is,  in the context of the whole,  doubly ironic.  And no matter how surreal things get (and trust me,  they get very,  very surreal) , the cast keep everything grounded,  as if what they're experiencing at any given moment is the most natural thing in the world. Of course,  it isn't all perfect.  The wildly unexpected plot twist at the end of the second act will be too much for some people (there were multiple walk-outs at the screening I attended) . The film is also just a beat or two too long,  and the bottom does fall out to an extent before it reaches its madcap d<e9>nouement.  There's also a mid-credit scene that serves as a kind of epilogue that I'm led to believe was a re-shoot when test audiences found the initial ending too abrupt.  however,  it doesn't entirely work,  and I would have much preferred the original,  somewhat darker,  ending.  Also,  with so much satire and humour floating about,  almost by definition,  However,  the flip side to this is that when Riley's humour does hit the target,  it's sublime - Mr.  _______ literally beep-denied a name,  for example,  or Cash's two-word rap being gleefully cheered by Lift's assembled yuppies. Sorry to Bother You is as timely and relevant as it is funny and irreverent,  as progressive as it is radical,  and as inventive as it is confident.  Exploring the intersection between race and economics from a wholly satirical point-of-view,  the film both condemns and sympathises with those who choose to sell-out in some way so as to climb the ladder of success.  Now in his late-40s,  Riley is a veteran political protestor,  a Chomsky -literate agitator,  who is here positing that the most significant divide in the US isn't between white and black,  it's between those with money and those without.  Suggesting that the desire to cross this divide can lead to a herd mentality,  the film argues that the labour force must never forget their collective strength,  and must never turn on one another,  as in such a situation,  management will use workers like horses.  A hugely impressive debut,  and it will be interesting to see what Riley tackles next."
"Sorry to Bother You is a strange,  surreal,  hilarious satire guided by the intentionally unsteady hand of rapper-activist turned debut director,  Boots Riley.  It dabbles in commentary on media,  society,  race and working-class issues-so many poignant messages,  some more successfully delivered than others.  but I'm okay with that.  I take this wonderful creation much more for its entertainment value than anything else.  The messages that do resonate should come through clearly.  Riley's story doesn't shroud itself in murky metaphors.  It tells us exactly how to interpret the bizarre world he has created.  Rising star LaKeith Stanfield plays Cassius 'Cash' Green,  a deep-thinker who lives in his uncle's garage with his artistic girlfriend named Detroit (the invaluable Tessa Thompson) . It comes as no surprise that a man who goes by Boots would opt to give his characters unusual names.  These two are just the beginning.  To collect enough scratch to keep up with his rent and put gas in the rusty bucket he drives,  he takes a job as a telemarketer.  When a wise elder advises him to use ""white voice"" to improve his sales,  Cash starts to rake in the green.  After he rises the ranks of the telemarketing world,  ascending to the divine status of power caller,  he attracts the attention of an eccentric,  drug-fueled CEO,  Steve Lift (Armie Hammer)  WorryFree (a place where employees feel anything but)  But when the secret leaks to the public,  his stock unexpectedly skyrockets,  and Lift is declared a pioneering genius.  but big business carried on.  As union organizer Squeeze (Steve Yuen)  explains to Cassius,  but they don't know what to do about it,  they just learn to get used to it. "" If you think you have any of this plot figured out,  think again.  It makes a radical left turn in the third act that will tempt some viewers to jump ship.  My advice: stay on board.  Even if you don't want to totally buy in,  just hang around to see where this new direction leads.  The film flies along with such easy energy early,  then hits turbulence when trying to figure out how to end this thing.  But at some point,  one must come down from every trip.  Even with as jarringly fantastical as it is,  in many ways this movie also feels incredibly real.  As Riley puts it,  he strives to ""break down reality to help us better understand it. "" Mission accomplished."
"but just prepare to be shocked and a little messed up by this movie.  It's an understatement to say that it's not the movie you think you're gonna see.  With that being said, ..but it definitely messed us up a little.  You're gonna want to phone a friend after the movie ends so you can re-adjust to the real world."
"Good: The concept was original and different and the first two-thirds of the movie were interesting/engaging.  But the true standout is Lakeith Stanfield's character who is relatable with his struggles and goal in life of making a difference and mattering in the world.  I do like the themes the film tackles like the corruption of big companies with its hunger for power and money. Bad: The film bounces around too much with its subplots.  Near the end,  the story goes for more of a shock value and the social problems it started to develop gets lost in a bad acid trip.  Some of the ideas and characters were not fully developed as a result of the film being fast paced and messy.  but my audience was laughing for the most part.  however I believe there is a certain crowd that will absolutely admire this film and praise it for its originality and humor.  but I appreciate Boots Riley's first time directorial debut ambitions."
"but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer brilliance of this satirical masterwork.  this film joins some of the finest satires of its generation--from ""South Park"" to some of the best episodes of ""Saturday Night Live"" to ""Wild Tales. ""The story follows Cassius,  an African-American telemarketer in Oakland.  he quickly rises through the ranks of his profession--and ends up getting a hefty promotion.  All of a sudden,  things start to spiral out of control.  I definitely won't give anything else away,  as doing so would spoil what clearly must be experienced for oneself.  The film's script is incredibly strong and is consistently hilarious.  but incredibly frank and on-the-nose in its brutal honesty.  The film's social consciousness and commentary intersect in ways that are thoughtful,  snappy,  and deeply rooted in (often unfortunately)  a sense of genuine realism.  Yet the film's image of the world is not equal to our society with microscopic precision,  as its humor often tends to look at current societal issues with the mirror of a macabre fun-house. Performances in the film are outstanding throughout,  and the film is incredibly engaging throughout its run time.  Free of pacing issues,  it moves at a fast pace and twists and turns so unusually that one will never know what could happen next.  This erratic nature is truly part of the film's genius.  If such a style of narrative filmmaking was attempted to be used as a technique in almost any other film,  Also noteworthy is the film's soundtrack,  which is a superb mix of rap and pop.  but viewers will be all the more thankful for its genuine audaciousness upon the film's conclusion. Riley's ambitious filmmaking has a variety of possible influences (Spike Lee,  Jordan Peele,  Alejandro Inarritu,  Charles Kaufman)  yet feels wholly original--and genuinely,  howlingly funny and socially relevant despite being so unconventional--from beginning to end."
"Ok so I literally created an account just to review this movie let's goI saw this movie last night with a few of my friends.  None of us knew anything about this movie going in other than it had something to do with telemarketing and was highly rated online.  Afterwards,  we had to go get some ice cream and sit down for a bit to scream and process what the hell we just watched.  but is mostly just a total mindscrew of a movie with no real purpose or direction.  The whole movie is confusing,  feels like it's 4 hours long,  and the goddamn horse-people freaked me out so much I felt like I was gonna have nightmares.  but it took such a bizarre turn that I genuinely feel like I can't understand what just happened.  it wasn't my kind of movie but if you go into it expecting a wild,  nonsensical LSD trip then go for it, But beware the horses."
"I saw ""Sorry to Bother You"", starring Lakeith Stanfield-Atlanta_tv,  Get Out; Tessa Thompson-Westworld_tv,  Thor:Ragnarok; Danny Glover-Proud Mary,  the Lethal Weapon movies and Armie Hammer-The Birth of a Nation,  Mirror Mirror.  This is a weird movie.  I like weird but it has a lot of symbolism-which I'm not too fond of-and it is not like it is being advertised.  From the trailers,  it looks like a comedy about a telemarketer that finds a way to make money,  but then it goes into some really weird ......stuff.  Lakeith plays the telemarketer trying to make a living-unsuccessfully-that gets tips from his co-worker,  Danny,  on how to use his 'white voice' to get more sales.  FYI: David Cross does Lakeith's white voice,  Patton Oswalt does another character's voice and Rosario Dawson does the voice of the elevator.  Tessa plays Lakeith's girlfriend,  who is an anti-establishment radical type.  The other telemarketers decide to go on strike,  just as Lakeith gets promoted and moves upstairs.  That is where Lakeith meets Armie,  the boss that is against unions-Duh! -and heads a separate company called 'Worry Free Living' that provides food,  security and health care for anyone that will work for free.  Then,  there is the horse/human hybrids that are used as slave labor.  Remember,  I said weird.  Forest Whitaker does one of the voices of the hybrids.  This movie is not for everyone.  It's directed by first timer Boots Riley,  who is in a rap/hip hop group called 'The Coup'. It is different and if you like social satire and symbolism,  you may enjoy it more than I did.  It's rated ""R"" for language,  drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.  I would not buy it on DVD.  I wouldn't rent it,  either-unless I was high or something.  If you really wanted to see it,  I'd wait until it comes to cable."
"This richly inventive satire may have been 10 years in the making but it speaks trenchantly to our moment.  but it also works as a pseudo-apology to the film viewer for interrupting his entertainment-time with a rude awakening to our harsh social reality.  The profit-uber-alles ethos is propelling us into a fascist state.    The initial satire targets corporate salesmanship.  Management create an illusion of ""family"" and ""team"" to harness their commission-only drones selling delusions of success through unnecessary products like encyclopedias.  (There's an endangered species.   But the telemarketer's prime customer has a larger humanity to numb.  They offer Worry-Free Living,  a sweeping assurance policy that will guarantee its clients a life of work,  ""security, "" minimal comfort,  in short,  an updated version of slavery.  Company head Steve Lift carries the promise of improvement in his name.    Even its glossy commercials reveal the system's total abandonment of privacy,  of individual living.  In exchange for guaranteed - i. e. , unending - labour the clients enjoy living in rooms full of bunk beds,  with drab uniforms and meals of slop provided.  This is the no-worry life that can seduce individuals to resign their humanity.   In offering to meet all its workers' earthly needs,  that company seems to promise a kind of socialism.  Instead it delivers a tyranny,  a total reduction of its workers to a brutish life.  Here the film parallels the conversion of the pretence to populism in America and Europe into right-wing fascism.    Company head Lift takes his dehumanizing one step further.  humans with exploded muscle strength but with the heads of horses.  This brutalizing makes human labourers all the more efficient.  For a saving grace,  they get the horse's schlong too.  Every cloud. ...  Our nebbish hero Cassius Green grabs the telemarketing gig as a last resort.  His surprising flair gets him promoted to Power Caller,  which llifts him to meeting the impressive Steve.  Having succeeded as seller,  Cassius is now converted to product.  Lift offers him $100, 000, 000 to undergo the horse change and work as the company's agent in the workers' union for five years,  after which a serum will - hopefully - return him to human normalcy.  He gets to keep the schlong.  But the company's spectacular profits valorize even that evil practice.  Money talks; who knew?  Only by submitting himself to painful abuse and humiliation on TV can Cassius air his scandalous revelation.   The film's activism is encapsulated in Cassius's girlfreind,  Detroit.  but her real calling is politically driven art.  In addition to her paintings and sculpture,  she does a performance piece in which she also maintains dignity in the face of the audience's (invited)  abuse.  That anticipates Cassius's strategy.    Detroit's very name evokes the America of economic and racial injustice.  In his name Cassius combines the ""slave name"" of the revolutionary fighter Mohammad Ali with the society's hunger for the long green,    The central characters may be black but in the film's major concern race gives way to class.  This struggle is not black vs white but Haves vs Haven'ts.    In their speech Cassius and Detroit have left behind their street-smart.  But Cassius's sales success lies in his affecting an even whiter tone,  the voice of the Privileged/Confident/Carefree.  That's economic not racial.  Cassius's success not only pulls him away from his striking colleagues but dooms him to his boss's designs.    This dystopian Oakland satires sends a clear message.  You have nothing to lose but tyranny."
Its quirky exterior (love that soundtrack and those earrings)  but then through the indie candy coating burst some terrifying plot points (see the final riot through the crack)  and provoking and poignant thoughts on capitalism and the normalizing of evil-all of it creating this quasi-surrealist sort of tone that's highly discomforting in how ultimately real it feels.  8.
"Orphaned and sent to live with his Uncle Johnathan (Jack Black) , Lewis (Owen Vaccaro)  soon discovers that his Uncle is a Warlock,  and his neighbour Mrs.  Zimmerman (Cate Blanchett)  is a witch.  Together the three of them investigate the mansion that their living in - that formally belonged to a powerful and evil Warlock Issac Izard (Kyle MacLachlan) , particularly the mysterious ticking that they can hear at night,  seemingly coming from within the walls themselves. Truth be told,  The reviews have talked about this being Eli Roth's first family friendly film but there isn't honestly a lot for the parents in the audience to sink their teeth into.  The performances are generally OK,  although Jack Black does resort to ""Jack Black"" a few more times than is really necessary.  The story is OK,  though it ends somewhat abruptly.  but this is the exception rather than the norm,  in fact most of the time the film is visually charming.  but most would cope without any issues.  You're unlikely to hate it but you probably won't love it either."
but the boy can't act and it was painfully distracting.  It would also be more interesting if more fun magic tricks were shown.
"Good cast,  good special effects & interesting storyline,  yet it lacked story depth & attention to story details.  If had been done right,  the story could have been better than mediocre.  First and foremost this story is about 3 people in search for love,  family and finding where one belongs.  The screenplay failed to show hints of romantic love between Jack Black & Cate Blanchett's characters.  Jack Black showed little attachment to the Boy which could have been demonstrated by hands on magical instruction by Black to the Boy.  Thirdly,  the movie could have spent a scene or two with the ""true friend"" with the boy.  Finally,  I thought the back story of Black's nemesis was clumsily done.  It seemed to me that this movie was half baked instead of being nurtured into a mature film that could have been fully entertaining to kids and adults.  but I give this film a 6. 5 to 7."
"The scenery and designs were decent,  and that's it for the positives.  The writing was atrocious,  and the acting was even worse.  Jack Black sadly gave the best performance,  and even THAT was garbage.  Cate Blanchett didn't sound like she had a clue what she was talking about.  And the kid. ..this is Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker levels of bad.  There was one scene in the beginning where he talked about the death of his parents,  and his fake crying was so unconvincing that I burst out laughing.  but it was THAT bad!  I urge everyone reading this to save your money.  Stay home and pop in a DVD to watch with the kids."
"I honestly don't understand how people can call this great family entertainment.  I'm not even sure how this movie got a PG rating.  It is definitely NOT for kids!  Unless you consider shape shifting witches,  warlocks,  a demon,  a blood spell that brings the dead back to life,  murderous vomiting jack-o- lanterns,  and creepy dolls that attack,  well you get the picture,  not good material for kids.  But I figured PG rating - what could be wrong?  The themes were way more for adults than children,  I'm just sorry that I didn't walk out when I wanted to but I kept thinking the movie could somehow redeem itself.  Save your time,  your money,  and your kids brains - don't get sucked in by this trash."
Masking as a children's story but really a dark evil story.  Not for children.  Boring and awful dark content.
"I'm a fan of Denzel Washington and enjoyed the first ""Equalizer"" movie.  That said,  ""The Equalizer"" was not a film I was necessarily clamoring for a sequel to--although I still was looking forward to it since Denzel Washington and the action scenes in the trailer would be worthwhile.  After seeing ""The Equalizer 2"" at an advance screening,  it's an entertaining ride for adult action junkies that is on par with the first movie in terms of quality. Denzel returns as Robert McCall,  a vigilante-type figure and former special forces operative who begins the movie on a mission in Turkey.  After such prologue,  the film centers in on its primary narrative thread: a woman who he worked with on multiple missions has been killed by thugs in Brussels.  The rest of the film primarily concerns McCall's attempt to bring the perpetrators of such heinous crime to justice,  although the film also contains multiple sub-plots--including a new,  older adolescent-age character who could theoretically become somewhat of a prot<e9>g<e9> to McCall in a possible third movie in the franchise. The action scenes in ""The Equalizer 2"" are thrilling and intense.  but the film certainly brings the white-knuckle goods.  The film's action-packed finale scene,  a climatic showdown in the midst of an incredibly rough hurricane,  is thoroughly effective and satisfying.  Just like the first movie,  the violence in ""The Equalizer 2"" certainly earns its R rating.  Denzel Washington is great as McCall,  blending a unique mix of charisma and ferocity.  Just like in the first movie,  he is able to carry the film on all of its levels from beginning to end.  That said,  the film does have one large flaw--that of which the story is highly predictable.  If you've seen any other ""vigilante""-style action movie before,  you'll be able to guess the key plot elements well before they unfold,  and the film's sole attempt at a plot twist can be guessed within the first 20 minutes of the movie.  Fans of the first movie and Denzel Washington should be able to look past such banality and enjoy the action-packed ride,  and I do recommend the film to them."
"I was well entertained on Sunday when I watched the film.  Denzel Washington is a favorite actor of mine.  I have seen such good films of his in the past: Philadelphia( 1993) , The Pelican Bried( 1993) , Crimson Tide( 1995) , Virtuosity( 1995) , Fallen( 1998) , The Bone Collector( 1999) , The Hurricane( 1999) ,Training Day( 2001) , John Q( 2002)  and many more. ..I am also a great fan of director Antoine Fuqua and I love his style of direction.  The movie continues from the previous one,  Robert McCall( Washington)  now lives in a diverse apartment complex in urban Massachusetts.  He is working as a Lyft driver and assists the less fortunate with the help of his friend,  Susan Plummer.  One day,  Susan and DIA operative Dave York,  McCall's former teammate,  are called to investigate an apparent murder-suicide of an agent and his wife in Brussels.  When the two separate after reaching their hotel,  Susan is murdered in an apparent robbery.  When he receives the news,  McCall begins to investigate both her death and the case she was investigating. The action sequences in the film,  background sound-effects and cinematography are extremely well executed.  Antoine is a director with great vision and you can see that in all his movies.  Denzel gives another excellent performance and his acting is very convincing.  I give the film a rating of 8/10 because the film is a solid entertainer and held my attention the whole time."
"In this day and age,  I need to see a hero like this.  but a kind man (to those who deserve it) . Washington is the closest thing we have to the next Clint Eastwood.  That quiet swagger is very captivating.  I hope they make another."
"As someone that enjoyed the genre thrills of the first film,  I thought surely the second one,  most likely,  would be more of the same.  I felt. .. that it failed miserably.  Knowing that Denzel Washington doesn't usually make sequels,  I figured this one should probably be pretty good.  It feels like,  though,  that he just cashed a paycheck for this one.  A long section in the middle just feels aimless,  and like it's just wasting time.  and then just kind of wastes time.  but by then,  I was checked out.  Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman are wasted in their roles,  and have very little to do.  The good guy vs.  bad guy fight at the end just feels like every other action movie,  and just isn't that impressive.  Very disappointed with this film.  They could have done so much better!"
Well performed and excellent character development by all characters and parties performed with gusto.  Music was very appropriate for the continuing changing scenes.  I only hope that Mr Washington accepts a third installment to round out the reprisal of the original TV series.  Edward Woodward would have enjoyed the display of looking out for others after retirement to make up for past transgressions for a thankless job.
"Plot holes,  no story,  no main villain,  edited with an old butcher's clever,  boring from start to finish,  muslim,  race mixing and gender neutral agenda pushing all over the place. You have no idea whats going on half way through,  story so thin you dont really care to find out what happens next.  Makes no difference if Denzel Washington is in this movie or Jim Carrey. Where is the main villain man ? What exactly is Denzel doing throughout the film nobody cares.  Fight scenes boring,  gun fights a great big yawn. ..It felt like someone is trying to force a piece of rotten slice of bread down your throat and wash it down with milk gone bad.  Or for people who like to scroll through movies with a mouse and watch the whole film in 6 seconds max. I will probably catch up with all future Denzel movies after he is long gone and Im just too bored.  Or watch Nicholas Cage films instead.  Which is not good. Just change the movie title."
This is a film that spends most of its time in a haze.  A bunch of unrelated set pieces loosely being woven together by such a small string.  There aren't really any stakes for Denzel's character.  but I don't understand how he read this script and signed on.  The only thing great in this movie is Denzel's performance.
"Of course this movie was great,  it's Denzel.  In the first sequel of his career,  it didn't disappoint.  Very methodical.  In the first film,  he was the hunted.  In this one,  he is the hunter.  First movie has a fantastic villain that was just as powerful as Denzel.  but with that being said,  still a must see."
"This movie is all over the place and is,  in no way at all,  like the first.  I should have left 20 minutes in.  Total waste of time."
"Outlaw King is one of the most visually breathtaking films of 2018,  the cinematography,  the set pieces,  costume designs,  are absolutely perfect.  The story,  based of a true event,  is very engaging,  However,  the film feels like it should have been longer,  which makes me believe that it should have been a mini series instead.  The period in which this film takes place,  was a major event in Scottish history,  and they crammed it all within a 2 hour movie.  Some of it works,  and some of it doesn't. The actors are all fantastic,  Chris Pine was great as the Bruce,  although I would have preferred Gerard Butler in the role,  Pine gave a very convincing performance.  Most of the other characters are very bland,  and you don't get much time to spend with them,  Aaron Taylor Johnson however was the highlight of the film,  and I wish we got to see more of him.  He was insanely entertaining here,  as a savage lunatic eager to avenge his family. Some reviews I have read have pointed out that the English are portrayed in a very negative manner,  which is true.  They are made to be evil in this film,  burning castles,  but this film is as historically accurate as possible,  But like I said before,  everything is crammed together quickly,  if they had made a mini series they could have showed more of the story. The action scenes are brilliant in the Outlaw King,  and you can tell that most of it was inspired by Braveheart,  from the gore,  However I feel the movie put style over story and characters.  I would watch it just for its visuals alone.  but history buffs,  or hardcore movie goers will love this film for what it is,  a good piece of entertaining visuals and action. 7."
"This film has so much potential,  the scenery is stunning and the acting was strong (Pugh,  in particular was excellent) . The problem with this film is that it felt far too rushed.  The scene with the queen's declaration of love after barely establishing a relationship between the characters on screen showcasing this problem. I'd love to see the full directors cut.  It seems Director David McKenzie has been caught out by perhaps trying to appeal to the masses by cutting around 30 mins from the original screening in Toronto,  following heavy criticism from the film critics.  Critics often get it wrong,  without proper screen testing it seems like a knee jerk reaction has been taken,  which is a shame. Hopefully he releases a directors cut,  the full,  as intended Toronto screening,  or a longer version of what has been released on Netflix,  I would like to see if that solves the pacing issues,  and if so,  this could easily move up a couple of points on the rating."
"This was a real enjoyable movie!  A lot better than I expected seeing some of the previous reviews,  just shows you should watch & see yourself!  The filming locations were beautiful & the actors were believable,  good job all around!  I have to say Netflix did really good on this occasion!"
"Saw this at TIFF and it was definitely a fun and interesting movie.  However the scenes moved incredibly quickly,  and the writing didn't have a lot of heart.  Bruce is all the good guy and the king and prince of wales pure evil.  The characters are so much more complex in real life and adding that to the script could have made it fall a little less flat.  but not exactly an Oscar film."
"Good direction,  beautiful cinematography but just not clearest story to convert into a movie.  I'm sorry,  but this movie has little heart.  It doesn't have anywhere near the same emotional content that a movie like Braveheart does,  which is always going to be the comparison (due to the chronology and the frequent mentions of William Wallace) . All through the film you get the impression that Robert the Bruce is not fighting for worthy causes such as revenge,  his country or even freedom,  he's out for his own interests,  just trying to grab power for his own purposes.  He wants to be a king and now he has his opportunity to seize the crown.  Which means it's difficult to get behind the character and be emotionally involved in the story.  Overall,  but they could perhaps have chosen a clearer story for their historical epic.  Even the last battle scene feels a little rushed and just kind of tails off with a weird and slightly uncomfortable one on one sword fight at the end.  Perhaps a character like Boudicca,  Alfred the Great or Owain Glendower would provide a clearer historical protagonist and a more emotional story arc."
It wasn't great but was ok.  What made me give this a 5 was the final scene in the battle.  The idea that that would meet could be forgiven but that the Scots would let him walk away after 8 years of war and destruction and not trade him just would not have happened.  Rubbish!
"The movie was promising but the pace was to fast.  No character build up.  yeah most died didnt feel bad about characters dying even if they were the good guys.  The thing i couldnt look passed was how clean The costumes were,  so clean."
"OK,  but eventually there is a point where you have to title it 'Work of fiction'. This film is sufficiently removed from actual history that even 'Based on historical events' is bordering on flattery. I know,  I know.  But this film dresses itself up as some kind of historic truth.  If polititians or companies rewrote history for commercial gain and presented it as truth,  we'd rightly be up in arms.  God knows the real story and events are exciting enough without having to lard them up with hackneyed characatuers and cliches. The Bruce was a great man and a flawed man in a complex age of power politics.  His allegiances vis a vis Scotland and England were fluid at best.  The murder of Comyn was just that,  murder.  Edward II,  though a useless King in other ways had to be dragged from the battlefield - there was no mano a mano showdown.  I could go on.  but appreciate this is a 'Disney' film about boy with sword meets girl with modern sensibilities,  whilst charming minority group with pleasing ethnic music overcomes neighbours who are all shallow,  sadistic stereotypes.  It's the medieval equivalent of a 1940's war film with monocled German baddies. And the film?  Nice scenery,  bit of blokey bonding,  splatter battle scenes.  Not one you'd watch twice."
"I watch a lot of mediaval viking type stuff,  and to be fair the film looked pretty good,  the action scenes were done well and seemed relatively realistic. Chris Pine as a Scotsman though?  I don't think so,  his accent was awful and I struggled to hear what he was saying half the time. Arron Taylor Johnson was a little better,  though we seemed to only really see him screaming his head off as he violently killed English soldiers.  (Surprised to see him in this) The prince/ king wasn't bad either,  it didn't help that the script wasn't particularly well thought out - the relationship between Robert The Bruce and his wife I couldn't help laugh at,  it was so forced!  They have a really long almost slightly distasteful sex scene as well,  I actually said that out loud at the time. All in all,  nothing special,  5."
This was a very well made film about an intensely interesting bit of history during and after the life of William Wallace. Particularly recommended for those interested in Scottish / English or general European history
I loved this movie. .. it's beautiful in so many ways. .... from it's cinematography to perhaps its best quality which is its attention to detail the small moments that really impact you and give you characters you want to succeed!  It takes liberties. . yes. .. it's villains are a bit one dimensional. .. but I don't think that takes away from what this movie tries to do which is to give a snapshot of these people's lives in a visceral and very real feeling world. Great film certainly worth your time!
"Really a good film!  I do not get the weak reputation it recently got because it was a great and epic Knight's Tale and got everything a film like this needs to fulfill my expectations: Epic Look,  fantastic cinematography,  very decent acting and a very solid direction.  But there were many aspects that made up for that.  Chris Pine was pretty good in the lead as Robert the Bruce and turns into one of his best performances.  I liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson in an almost unrecognizable role and Billy Howle made a good villain.  Florence Pugh ones again turns into a charismatic performance.  Really one actress to look out for,  she will go places.  But also his character deserved to be flashier.  It's an interesting piece of history that influenced a lot of Great Brittain.  David Mackenzie sure knows how to direct epic scenes and I hope this was not the last time he touched this theretory.  The images were fantastic.  it is a shame we could not enjoy those images on the silver screen."
"Greetings again from the darkness.  Much was made of the 'artistic license' director Mel Gibson took in creating his own version of historical events and actions of William Wallace for his Oscar-winning BRAVEHEART (1995) . Director David Mackenzie (in his follow up to the excellent HELL OR HIGH WATER,  2016)  pays a bit more attention to historical details as he picks up the story at the end of Wallace's rebellion - and the beginning of the uprising led by Robert the Bruce. Chris Pine plays Robert the Bruce,  a man forced to pledge loyalty to Kind Edward I and England prior to leading the rebellion.  It's the year 1304 and director Mackenzie's opening sequence is a several minute long tracking shot that is simply superb.  It features our introduction to Robert the Bruce (Pine) , King Edward I (Stephen Dillane)  and Prince Edward (Billy Howle,  ON CHESIL BEACH) , as well as an early swordfight and an eye-popping fireball shot from an enormous catapult into the protective wall of a distant castle. Not long after,  we learn William Wallace has been killed,  the King has provided Robert the Bruce a wife in Elizabeth de Burgh (Florence Pugh,  LADY MACBETH)  However,  it does lead to his being named King of Scots by the Church,  and he slowly begins to build his forces.  Of course,  but never in spirit. Pine plays Robert the Bruce as the strong,  (mostly)  silent leader,  and James Douglas (a manic,  crazy-eyed Scotsman bent on revenge) . Ms.  Pugh brings courage and a headstrong nature to Elizabeth (in far too limited a role)  Dillane shows us a worn down King Edward I who gets the film's best line ... ""I am so sick of Scotland! ""The two words of the title are actually separated by a slash in the opening credits; a device meant to emphasize the dual sides to the man and his actions.  In addition to that opening long shot,  there is a visually stunning sequence of a nighttime raid on a camp site.  Unfortunately after that,  we get mostly mud and blood,  including the pivotal Battle of Loudon Hill which features the ultimate in home field advantage.  but mostly it's elaborate and detailed moviemaking (with a few downright silly moments)  that never fully clicks.  Perhaps that's a factor of having 5 different writers involved.  With many familiar faces from ""Game of Thrones"", it will be interesting to see how this plays on laptops and TVs via Netflix.  Another Robert the Bruce film is scheduled for theatrical release in 2019,  and the inevitable comparison will be made at that time."
"Ccflan and chong_an did indeed ""see the same film"" as I did.  This one has been shot so as to register particularly well on a large screen.  Not often do I find seeing a film a powerful,  heartening experience as this one is.  Catch it soon!"
"but they play that one-dimension spot on.  Liam Neeson is one of those guys.  Another example is Jason Statham.  Their roles are all the same,  scripts slightly tweaked,  but that isn't on Liam) .Bottom line is,  but on a commute instead of a plane.  Liam Neeson plasy his same old self and plays his usual one-dimensional badass role.  He did his job once again.  This movie will bring in okay-enough numbers,  and we will be presented with Liam Neeson's next challenge in about another year. Same old,  decent-enough action movie."
"I wanted to like this.  It's cool that Liam Neeson launched an action-hero career later in life,  it seems like he's mostly picked nonsensical action scripts since then.  Non-Stop was far-fetched but if you did a little extra suspension of disbelief (which I did)  But this? ? This? ! This is one of the silliest,  most implausible scripts ever written.  The entire premise makes zero sense.  ALL-SEEING,  ALL-KNOWING ""Bad Guys"" (Well,  Vera Farmiga)  can make literally anything happen at any time,  kill anyone inside or outside the commuter train,  and see what's going on inside the commuter train at all times - and yet they can't locate and kill the single witness who's on the train.  Thus,  they need to pull Liam Neeson's strings to make it happen.  However,  the film does have some very good action sequences,  so if you're going into without any concern for story at all,  you might have some fun with this one.  But come on,  Vera Farmiga,  I expect much better from YOU!"
I would say that liam's acting is at it's best as usual but  and here comes the spoilers!  if these criminal minds that pushed liam to do what he did!  can kill an FBI agent on board and an old man -that was on board- in the streets because thay know that liam wrote something of an SOS for him in the newspaper he was reading.  How come they couldn't kill the 16 years old witness girl!
"If you've seen one Neeson film,  you've probably seen them all.  Despite having already mastered the art of playing the grizzled,  Neeson is back with The Commuter,  in which he plays an unsuspecting ... well ... commuter,  who is drawn into a criminal conspiracy which could kill everyone on-board.  but it's one that Neeson excels in,  in fact,  he may be too good at it by now.  With all that said,  The Commuter,  much like Taken,  Taken 2,  Taken 3,  Non-Stop,  A Walk Among the Tombstones,  Run All Night and Schindlers List,  is another fun Neeson film which you'll probably enjoy much more than you'd be willing to admit."
"This is a horrible movie.  There is nothing about it that makes any sense at all.  but The Commuter asks that you also suspend your common sense and any understanding you might also have of human nature or physics.  From the moment Liam Neeson boards the train,  there is no decision,  action or technical detail which makes any sense at all. The movie's vertiginous opening sequence is meant to convey that Neeson's life is stuck in a rut,  however,  that we're talking Liam Neeson,  who's a former cop who now sells life insurance.  (What? ) Once aboard the train,  he's approached by Vega Farmiga.  Neeson and Farmiga?  Ah,  I think,  life doesn't get better that this.  Foolish boy. Farmiga makes him an offer he can't refuse.  And one which we can't understand: He has about an hour to find one particular passenger - on a crowded commuter train - carrying a bag and using ""Prynne"" as an alias.  No problem.  Faced with that task,  the movie slowly devolves into a mashup of ""Clue"" and ""Murder on the Orient Express"" as Neeson tries to find the passenger.  Much hilarity does not ensue. Although the plot makes no sense,  at least,  I thought,  I could look forward to Neeson's ""Popeye"" moment: ""That's all I can stands,  I can't stands no more.  however,  even that moment is disappointing as it's both watered down and of his own making. The one redeeming facet of the movie is the excellent cast.  Farmiga unfortunately appears in person only briefly.  Other cast members include Patrick Wilson,  Jonathan Banks,  Sam Neill and Elizabeth McGovern,  along with lots of great actors playing passengers.  Notable among those with bit parts is Florence Pugh,  fresh off her award-winning star-turn in Lady Macbeth. Do not see this movie in a theater,  do not stream the movie or rent the DVD,  and consider cancelling your cable,  Internet and cell services to minimize the chance that you might accidentally encounter it."
"I feel bad for Liam Neeson.  He never could match what he achieved with ""Taken"" despite attempt after attempt.  The skeleton for a great film is in place and the first act was intriguing and extremely riveting.  By the time it ends,  everything descends in to utter nonsense.  It's as if the writer of this film took months to craft half the movie and then the studio called and told him he had 48 hours to finish so he slapped together the second half jacked up on caffeine and doughnuts.  Either that or his 12 year old son snuck in to his office and finished it for him.  It's like the writer had no idea where this was going to start and it went out of control and veered off the tracks. .. quite literally.  What seemed like a clever lead character turns out to be a near buffoon.  The twists are obvious and everything feels like a wasted opportunity."
"Wheres the beef of this movie?  Mike is supposed to kill Prynne to get the evidence regarding the death of a city planner thrown,  pushed or jumped out of a building, or his wife And kid die.  So why did the guy jump or be thrown out the window (by an alleged cop) , whats,  the conspiracy?  Why did he go out the window?  No explanation why?  Why kill Prynne except as a witness with what evidence is she carrying.  its too big to be a thumb drive,  so what is it.  Why did the guy fly out the window and why was Murphy involved."
"Ok,  so this is garbage.  Confusing,  bizarre storyline,  coupled with a never-ending commute,  strange character encounters and the worst stunts and CGI this side of WWE. Utterly appalling nonsense.  Non of the gritty action that you'd be used to with Liam Neeson.  Just a half-baked storyline,  some cobbled together action and not much else. Avoid like the plague."
"But this. .. this is a masterpiece.  it awakened my mind to things we see on a daily basis but decide to ignore.  It was a big slap in the face,  to be honest.  As I watched,  I hated myself for having food and shelter.  I hated the fact that I paid 14. 000 LBPs for my own pleasure and enjoyment to watch a movie.  I hated the fact that I bought a $1 worth of pop corn for $7.  Why do I get to enjoy a three-hour movie whilst others need that money for a three-day food supply?  For those who still haven't seen it,  it's a story of a supposedly 12-year old boy who gets sued for stabbing a ""son of a bitch"" (as the boy,  Zain describes him) . It depicts the life of a typical Lebanese poor family,  only if the word poor was enough.  It portrays how they eat,  how they dress,  how they talk and behave and what they do for a living.  It was so REAL that I thought it was actual footage from Zain's life.  The movie also displays the life of an Ethiopian woman who has no permit and who was knocked up by some guy and gave birth to a baby she can barely support.  Oh,  speaking of the Ethiopian woman; I was meaning to mention,  as soon as the movie starts,  we see Zain at court and then we also see the Ethiopian,  At this point I'm really curious as of what this is going to be about and some guy behind me makes a ""funny"" joke about the scene saying ""oh, ""... I don't know why but I thought I'd mention that because it left me in shock. .. we'll get back to that later.  Capharnaum addresses poverty,  illiteracy,  ignorance,  cruelty,  racism,  unawareness and child abuse.  On the other hand,  it also addresses kindness,  innocence,  forgiveness and faith.  A 12-year old boy taking care of a baby was just so heartwarming and beautiful.   Zain's personality is amazingly complex and in him one can touch awareness and illiteracy at the same time.  Innocence and violence.  Politeness and insensitivity.  Good and bad.  Love and hate.   He had a vision,  he had a message.   His message was bigger than governments and countries.  It was bigger than you and me.  It was a message that we decide to laugh about instead of help spread.  The message is simplified in one word: AWARENESS. About the guy I mentioned earlier,  lets hope he has learned something from the movie. ..Lets make this movie our prayer before going to bed every night. .. Then,  we could try and change the world to the better. Nadine Labaki keeps on dazzling us with her great work. .. I can't wait for the next one.  We,  as Lebanese,  are so proud of you.  And the whole world should be.  Much love."
"This is what you call art.  This is not just a movie,  this is a story of the hardships of life told from the eyes of a beautiful boy.  Nadine Labaki out did herself by portraying the reality that most countries are going through in this time and age. Do not believe the negative reviews.  This is not at all about refugees,  they do not even cover this topic in the movie.  This is about survival in the toughest and most heartbreaking of situations. This movie should be on everybody's watch list.  but that's life these days. Watch it for the sake of the children like Zain."
The movie will destroy you and will change your look toward street beggers refugees and foreign house keepers
"A moving epic film with a cute precocious kid?  Check!  A film designed to make me cry? - Check!  Parents as the protagonists?  Check!  A film that entertained me and moved me?  Yes?  That's all I ask of this film.  Why all the 1/10 reviews from do gooder film reviewers- ""I work in Syria,  blah blah blah"" well a film about your life probably isn't entertaining.  Stop questioning the political and economic motives and enjoy an entertaining and engrossing film with a fabulous cast- isnt that why we go to the theatre?"
